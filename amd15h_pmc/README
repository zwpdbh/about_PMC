This is a Linux kernel module for programming event counters on AMD10h/15h
processors.  It is tested with kernel 2.6.32 and will not work with
non-AMD10h/15h processors.  

For an overview of AMD performance counters see "AMD64 Architecture
Programmer's Manual Volume 2: System Programming" chapter 13.3.  For an
overview of the AMD10h/15h performance counters see "BIOS and Kernel
Developer's Guide (BKDG) For AMD Family 10h/15h Developer" chapter 3.14.

To initialize the module:

  $ make
  $ su
  ...
  # insmod amd15h_pmc.ko

The modules creates an interface for each CPU in
/sys/kernel/amd15h-pmc/ that allows root to program each performance
counter.  See test-config.sh for an example of how to program the
event counters.

config-pmc.sh is a useful script for programming the counters.

read-pmc.c is a useful tool for reading program counter values.

To disable the module:

  # rmmod amd15h_pmc.ko

You must disable the module if you want to use the performance
counters for something else (e.g. OProfile).
